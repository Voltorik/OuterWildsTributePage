      <h3 id="headline1">What is <i>Outer Wilds?</i></h3>
      <p>It’s difficult to describe what type of game <i>Outer Wilds</i> is, because to describe any specific plot point in detail will undermine the experience of that part of the game. I can certainly say that I love the game, but to articulate why would require me to ruin the best parts of it. The magic of Outer Wilds is found when playing it for the first time, completely blind. The less you know going into it, the fuller the experience is. I’ll try my best to describe some of the game’s most prevalent themes without spoiling anything specific.</p>
      <h3 id="headline2">Trusting your player</h3>
      <p><i>Outer Wilds</i>’ design philosophy differs from most modern games. There are no experience points to earn, no powerups to unlock, and no waypoint map markers to chase. Everything you need to complete the game is present the moment you step foot onto Timber Hearth. The game posits that the player is capable of exploring, thinking, learning, and adapting without need of such things. You are encouraged to explore the universe in which you are placed, not out of necessity, but out of wonder. What’s on the next planet? What secrets will I find? You may see a structure in the distance. How do I get there? What do I need to do to get inside? Its this “call to adventure” that drives much of what makes <i>Outer Wilds</i> a truly unique experience.</p>
      <h3 id="headline3">The engine of reality</h3>
      <p>The physics engine underpinning <i>Outer Wilds</i> is extraordinarily well implemented. The level of realism really adds to the core idea of trusting the player. Many of the problems in the game require you to develop intimate knowledge of the fundamental forces that act on its universe. Not to mention, the technical chops on display are just mind blowing. For example, the player is considered the origin or center of the game’s universe, so when you jump the player is not moving up relative to the game world, but instead the universe is being pushed down away from you. It's little things like this that make me appreciate all the attention to detail the developers had when making this game.</p>
      <h3 id="headline4">Sounds from the campfire</h3>

        , sets an atmosphere that is simultaneously awe inspiring, uplifting, and triumphant while also being somber, giving off a sense that you are on your own in an astronomically large universe. It’s hard to describe exactly how the music interacts with the major plot points from the game without ruining them, so just listen to a portion of this song to get a feeling of what I mean.
